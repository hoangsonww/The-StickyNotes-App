# Machine Learning Modules

This directory contains various machine learning scripts used in our application. Each script serves a specific purpose in the pipeline of our machine learning tasks, from data preprocessing to model predictions. Below is an overview of each script's functionality.

## Files and Descriptions

- `anomaly_detection.py`: Identifies unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, tagged as anomalies.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Prepares raw data for processing and analysis by cleaning and transforming datasets.
- `image_processing.py`: Handles image data transformations, augmentations, and preparations for model input.
- `language_translation.py`: Provides functionality for translating text between languages using machine learning models.
- `model_prediction.py`: Generates predictions from trained models based on input data.
- `model_training.py`: Contains routines to train machine learning models with prepared datasets.
- `recommendation_system.py`: Implements a recommendation algorithm to suggest items to users based on their preferences.
- `recommended_notes_generator.py`: Specifically generates note recommendations, likely for the StickyNotes app feature.
- `sentiment_analysis.py`: Analyzes text data to determine the sentiment expressed (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
- `speech_recognition.py`: Converts spoken words into text, facilitating voice commands or transcriptions.
- `text_classification.py`: Classifies text into predefined categories based on its content.
- `user_behavior_analysis.py`: Examines user actions and patterns to improve the user experience or for targeted marketing.

Please ensure you have the necessary data and models before running these scripts. Each script may require specific libraries and dependencies which are listed at the top of each file. Install them using `pip` or `conda` as per your environment setup.

For any queries or issues, please open an issue on the repository or contact the development team, at [info@movie-verse.com](mailto:info@movie-verse.com).
