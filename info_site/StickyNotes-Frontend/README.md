The `src` directory is the main hub for the application's frontend resources, including HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files. It's organized to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.

## Structure

  - `about.html`: Provides information about the application and its usage.
  - `calendar.html`: Implements the calendar feature of the application, allowing users to manage events and notes.
  - `privacy-policy.html`: Contains the privacy policy for the application.
  - `inspiration.html`: Displays inspirational quotes to motivate users.
  - `create-account.html`: Allows users to create an account to save their notes and settings.
  - `sign-in.html`: Provides a login form for users to access their accounts.

- `js`: Holds the JavaScript files that add interactivity to the application.
  - `script.js`: The main script file that contains logic for dynamic behavior and client-side functionality.
  - `quotes.js`: Contains functions to fetch and display inspirational quotes on the `inspiration.html` page.
  - `reset-password.js`: Implements the password reset functionality for users.
  - `sign-in.js`: Handles user authentication and login functionality.
  - `create-account.js`: Manages user registration and account creation.

## Guidelines

- **CSS**: When adding new styles, ensure they are responsive and consistent with existing styling rules. Use classes instead of IDs for styling to maintain a clean and reusable codebase.

- **HTML**: HTML files should be well-structured and semantic. Use proper indentation and comments to enhance readability.

- **JavaScript**: Keep the code modular and avoid global variables where possible. Comment on complex logic for better understanding and maintenance.

## Best Practices

- Test your changes in multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- Minify CSS and JavaScript files before deploying to production to improve load times.
- Validate HTML for accessibility to ensure the application is usable by all users.
