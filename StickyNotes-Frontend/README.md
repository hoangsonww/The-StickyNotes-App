# Source Directory

The `src` directory is the main hub for the application's frontend resources, including HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files. It's organized to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.

## Structure

- `css`: This folder contains cascading style sheets for the application's styling.
  - `style.css`: The main stylesheet that defines the look and feel of the application.

- `html`: Contains the HTML files, which are the building blocks of the application's content.
  - `about.html`: Provides information about the application and its usage.
  - `calendar.html`: Implements the calendar feature of the application, allowing users to manage events and notes.
  - `privacy-policy.html`: Contains the privacy policy for the application.

- `js`: Holds the JavaScript files that add interactivity to the application.
  - `script.js`: The main script file that contains logic for dynamic behavior and client-side functionality.

## Guidelines

- **CSS**: When adding new styles, ensure they are responsive and consistent with existing styling rules. Use classes instead of IDs for styling to maintain a clean and reusable codebase.

- **HTML**: HTML files should be well-structured and semantic. Use proper indentation and comments to enhance readability.

- **JavaScript**: Keep the code modular and avoid global variables where possible. Comment on complex logic for better understanding and maintenance.

## Best Practices

- Test your changes in multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- Minify CSS and JavaScript files before deploying to production to improve load times.
- Validate HTML for accessibility to ensure the application is usable by all users.
