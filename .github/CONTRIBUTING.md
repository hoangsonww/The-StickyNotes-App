## Getting Started

Before you begin, please ensure you have a GitHub account and have familiarized yourself with the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). This will involve creating a branch, making changes, submitting a pull request, and reviewing and discussing these changes.

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. To report a bug, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported.
2. If the issue is unreported, **open a new issue**. Provide a **clear title and description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for StickyNotes App, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the enhancement has already been suggested.
2. If it hasn't, **open a new issue**. Provide a **clear title and description**, as detailed as possible and if possible, include **examples** of how the enhancement would work.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to StickyNotes App? Look for the `good first issue` label in the issues section, which is a great start for newcomers.
