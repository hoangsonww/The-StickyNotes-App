# Middleware Directory

This directory contains middleware components for web applications using the Django and Flask frameworks. Middleware is a framework of hooks and a light API for globally altering the input or output of Django and Flask requests.

## Files and Descriptions

- `django_middleware.py`: This Python script contains middleware classes for Django applications. Middleware classes defined here can process requests before they reach the view and responses before they are sent to the client. Examples may include authentication middleware, logging, request enrichment, and more.

- `flask_middleware.py`: This script holds middleware functions for Flask applications. In Flask, middleware can be functions that wrap the application and manage the request pre-processing and response post-processing. It’s a way to globally change requests or responses in Flask apps.

## Usage

### Django
To use the `django_middleware.py`, you need to add the middleware classes to the `MIDDLEWARE` list in your Django project’s `settings.py` file. The order in which you add the classes defines the order of execution.

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    'path.to.django_middleware.YourMiddlewareClass',
    # ...
]
```

### Flask
For `flask_middleware.py`, you should wrap your Flask application with the middleware function or use the `@app.before_request` and `@app.after_request` decorators provided by Flask.

```python
from flask_middleware import YourMiddlewareFunction

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = YourMiddlewareFunction(app.wsgi_app)

# or using decorators
@app.before_request
def before_request_func():
    # ...

@app.after_request
def after_request_func(response):
    # ...
    return response
```
